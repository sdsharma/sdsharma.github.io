I was also able to boost route transition and render performance by 2-4x (worst case) and 10-20x (best case) and introduce viewport based lazy load and render occlusion culling to our web application.<div class=project__used><span class=project__used__item>Ember.js</span> <span class=project__used__item>Ember Data</span> <span class=project__used__item>Handlebars</span> <span class=project__used__item>Sass</span> <span class=project__used__item>Node.js</span> <span class=project__used__item>Java</span> <span class=project__used__item>Spaniel</span> <span class=project__used__item>JavaScript</span></div></div><div class=project><div class=time-place><div class=project__name><a href=https://www.vmware.com/ rel=noreferrer target=_blank class=arrow-link>VMware</a></div><div class=project__time>April 2017 - June 2017</div></div><div class=project__position>Software Engineering Intern</div><p>I rearchitected key portions of the <a href=https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html rel=noreferrer target=_blank class=underline-link>NSX Manager</a> web application in Angular 2+ using redux patterns with a centralized service layer.
